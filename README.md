# ROCKPAPERSCISSORS
this is a project to experiment building a webapp with Go

whilst the end webapp is very basic, this project has taught me how to utilise the following:

 - Go for building the game and creating the web application back end
 - HTML for displaying the page
 - JavaScript to interface the front and back ends
 - Heroku for hosting the webapp
 
 my knowledge of the above tools is very limited but they have been fun to explore
